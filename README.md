# CSGO Zip Line Plugin
#### This plugin allows players to navigate through maps using zip lines, adding a new level of excitement and creativity to the game.


## Known Bugs
- The sound effect for using the zip line only plays at the location where the player starts riding the zip line.
- While ziplining, crouching can sometimes get you in ground.


## Default Configuration

`const int ZIPLINE_REACH_LIMIT = 100;`
`const int ZIPLINE_SPEED = 450;`
`const int ZIPLINE_OFFSET = -70;`

##### You can change this values by editing the SP (SourcePawn) file and compiling the plugin again.

## Map
#### You can extract zipline pole model and textures from map using [VIDE (Valve Integrated Development Environment)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VIDE)
#### You can decompile map using [BSP Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/BSPSource)
